# Homework 4  KEY

library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)

# a) Use the R function nrow to confirm that the iris data frame has 150
# rows. Then use and show R code that  features a map function to confirm
# that the iris data frame has 150 rows.    6 points

iris

nrow(iris)

# map method 1
map_dbl(iris, length)

# map method 2
iris%>%
  map_dbl(length)



# b) Each column of the iris data frame has a unique number of values or objects. 
# For example, the column Sepal.Length has 150 values but 35 of them are unique. 
# Use and show R code that features a map function to find the number of unique values 
# or objects for each column of the iris data frame.     6 points

iris%>%
  map(unique)%>%
  map(length)

# 2
# Use and show R code that features a nested loop that will produce
# the  5 by 3 matrix shown below.      6 points

z <- matrix(nrow = 3, ncol = 5)
     for (m in 1:3) {
       for (n in 1:5) {
         z[m,n] <- -1*(m - n)
       }
     }
print(z)


# 3                6 points
                                                                                    
x<- rnorm(10,-10)

y<- rnorm(10,0)

z<- rnorm(10,10)

tibble(x,y,z,k)

# 4
# a) In statistics, a z score indicates the standard deviation distance
# between the mean and a specific value of the data set. What formula 
# is used to find a z score? Use and show R coding that features a 
# map function to iteratively find z scores across the lists given 
# above.      4 points

X <- list(12, 14, 15, 18, 19, 22,10,18,18)
X
Mean <- list(16, 16, 16, 16, 16,16,16,16,16)
Mean
sd <- list(2, 2, 2, 2, 2,2,2,2,2)
sd

pmap_dbl(list(X,Mean,sd), function(first, second, third) ((first - second) / third))

# b) The test statistic for a population mean is given by the formula 
# ((X -  mean)/s/sqrt(n)) Use and show R coding that features a map 
# function to iteratively find test statistics for population means across
# the lists given above.        6 points

pmap_dbl(list(X,Mean,sd), function(first, second, third) (first - second) / (third / sqrt(9)))
                                                                                     


# 5
V = c(10,15,17,22,32,38,42)
# a) Another purr package function is the keep( ) function. Research, explore,
# and use the keep( ) function to extract all number from the vector V given 
# above that are less than 20   4 points

V %>%
  keep(V<20)

# b) Another purr package function is the discard( ) function. Research, explore,
# and use the discard( ) function to eliminate all numbers from the vector V 
# given above that are less than 20    4 points

V %>%
  discard(V<20)

# 6
# Another purr package function is the safely( ) function. Research, explore, 
# and apply the safely( ) function to the given vector below as illustrated.
#   4 points

U = list(10, 15, "mary", 22, 32, "james", 42)
U

map(U, safely(~ .x + 15))

# In four of five sentences explain the specific output for this 
# and how the definition and the application of the safely() function is 
# used.

# If The safely function is applied to a vector(List), if confirms that an
# an operation can be executed on variable types that belong to the same 
# family of variables or not.  If variables belong to the same family the 
# function outputs the answer(result) and NULL. NULL indicating that no error
# ocurred. If variables do not belong to the same family, the safely function
# outputs NULL for a result (indicating that there is no result) and a description
# of the error.
