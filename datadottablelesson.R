# data.table vs tidyverse

# Use data.table for large data sets that you read
# in with fread()

# Let's read in a data table.  Do not forget to set your working
# directory.

# Using a data.table read in.

flights1 <- fread("nycdata.csv")  
flights1                      # note how large the data table is;  253,316 rows !!

# Consider the class(es) that data array belongs to

class(flights1)

#  Again, flights1 is a very large data table

nrow(flights1)
ncol(flights1)

dim(flights1)

# tidyverse read in

flights2 <- read_csv("nycdata.csv") # produces a tibble
flights2
  
class(flights2)



# Now let us take a look at the structure and data identification
# for the data table

str(flights1)  # data.table way


glimpse(flights2)  # tidyverse way

# Filtering/Arranging Rows (Observations)

# Just like in the tidyverse, we use logicals to 
# filter based on rows. The syntax for this is to place 
# the logicals inside a bracket. Let's find all flights 
# that left JFK and arrived at LAX.

# data.table way
flights1[origin == "JFK" & dest == "LAX"]

# equivalent tidyverse way
flights2 %>%
  select(carrier,origin,dest)%>%
  filter(origin == "JFK", dest == "LAX") 


# data.table

# To get a specific row(s), insert the number(s) into the 
# brackets.

# let's extract one row; row 3
flights1[3]    # insert the the row number in brackets

# Now let's extract rows 1, 3, and 207
flights1[c(1, 3, 207)] 

# equivalent tidyverse way      use the command slice
flights2%>%
  slice(3)


flights2%>%
  slice(1, 3, 207)


# Reorder rows by using the order() function inside the brackets.
# Let's reorder the rows alphabetically by origin, and break 
# ties in reverse alphabetical order by destination.

# data.table way
flights1[order(origin, -dest)]


# equivalent tidyverse way    
flights2 %>%
  select(year,month,day,carrier,origin,dest)%>%
  arrange(origin, desc(dest))


# Selecting Columns (Variables)

# To select a variable (a column), you also use bracket notation,
# but you place a comma before you select the columns. This idea
# is that you are selecting all rows (empty space after comma).

# We will select the column variables origin and dest

# data.table way
flights1[, .(origin, dest)]

# Or

flights1[, list(origin, dest)]

# Or

# Character Vector Method: Use c() with their character names

flights1[, c("origin", "dest")]

# Or


# Range Method: Use : to select variables within a range of 
# columns.

flights1[, origin:dest]


# equivalent tidyverse way
flights2 %>%
  select(origin, dest)




# To remove a column using the range or character methods, 
# place a ! before the columns to remove

# using data.table

flights1

flights1[, !c("year", "month")]

# or

flights1[, !(year:month)]


# Using tidyverse

flights2%>%
  select(-year, -month)


# Unlike the tidyverse, you filter rows and select columns in 
# one call for the data.table method rather than using two or 
# more separate functions.

# Lets find all year, month, day, and hour arrangements for 
# flights that leave JFK and arrive at LAX

# tidyverse way
flights2 %>%
  select(year, month, day, hour, origin, dest)%>%
  filter(origin == "JFK", dest == "LAX") -> f2
f2


# data.table way
flights1[origin == "JFK" & dest == "LAX", .(year, month, day, hour)]

# or (and more descriptive)  preferred method

flights1[origin == "JFK" & dest == "LAX", .(year, month, day, hour,
         origin, dest)]


# Creating New Variables (Mutate)

# The fastest way to create and remove variables in a data.table is
# by reference, where we modify the data.table, we don't create a 
# new data.table.

# Use := to modify a data.table by reference. You put the variable
# names (as a character vector) to the left of :=. You put the new 
# variables (as a list) to the right of :=.

# data.table way
flights1

flights1[, c("gain") := .(dep_delay - arr_delay)]
flights1

# equivalent tidyverse way    
flights2 %>%
  mutate(gain = dep_delay - arr_delay) ->
  flights3
flights3
# Let's see the new column
View(flights3)

# Removing a column 

## data.table way remove a column by setting that variable to NULL.

flights1

flights1[, c("gain") := .(NULL)]
flights1


## equivalent tidyverse way

flights3


flights3 %>%
  select(-gain) ->
  flights2
flights2

# Add multiple variables by separating them with columns.

flights1[, c("gain", "dist_km") := .(dep_delay - arr_delay, 
        1.61 * distance)]
flights1

# Eliminate the added columns by using NULL

flights1[, c("gain", "dist_km") := .(NULL, NULL)]
flights1


# Group Summaries

# You calculate summaries in the column slot. 
# It's best to use the list method.

# Lets find the mean for departure delays

# data.table way
flights1[, .(meandd = mean(dep_delay))]

## equivalent tidyverse way
flights2 %>%
  summarize(meandd = mean(dep_delay))


# Let's produce more that one summary

# data.table way
flights1[, .(meandd = mean(dep_delay), meanad = mean(arr_delay))]

## equivalent tidyverse way
flights2 %>%
  summarize(meandd = mean(dep_delay), meanad = mean(arr_delay))

# Count the number of rows with .N.

## data.table way
flights1[, .(.N)]

## equivalent tidyverse way
flights2 %>%
  count()

# In data.table, you create grouped summaries by simultaneously
# grouping and calculating summaries in one line, not separately 
# like in dplyr.


# In data.table, you use the by argument to specify the grouping
# variable. It should also be a list.

# data.table way
flights1[, .(meandd = mean(dep_delay)) , by = .(origin)]

# equivalent tidyverse way
flights2 %>%
  group_by(origin) %>%
  summarize(meandd = mean(dep_delay))

# Recoding

# Suppose you want to change the values of a variable. In the 
# tidyverse, we used recode() to do this.

#In data.table, we filter the rows then mutate by reference.

# Let's substitute AmerAir in for AA for the variable carrier.

# data.table way

flights1

flights1[carrier == "AA", carrier := "AmerAir"]
flights1

## equivalent tidyverse way
flights2

flights2 %>%
  mutate(carrier = recode(carrier, "AA" = "AmerAir")) ->
  flights2
flights2

View(flights2)

# Uniting

#To unite, use paste().

table5

# Convert to a data.table array

dt5 <- as.data.table(tidyr::table5)
dt5

# data.table way
dt5[, year := paste(century, year, sep = "")]
dt5[, century := NULL]
dt5


# Equivalent tidyverse methods

tidyr::table5 %>%
  unite(century, year, col = "year", sep = "")

# Or simply

table5 %>%
  unite(century, year, col = "year", sep = "")



# Chaining

# In the tidyverse, we chain commands by using the 
# pipe %>%. In data.table, we chain commands by adding 
# additional brackets after the brackets we used. 
# Data.table makes this very efficient.

# Let's calculate the mean arrival delay for american 
#airlines for each origin/destination pair, then order 
# the results by origin in increasing order, breaking 
# ties by destination in decreasing order.

# Lets find the mean of arrival delays(gouping
# by origin and destination) for the carrier AmerAir.

#tidyverse way and then alphabetizing by orgin.
flights2 %>%
  select(carrier,origin, dest)%>%
  filter(carrier == "AmerAir") %>%
  group_by(origin, dest) %>%
  summarize(meanad = mean(arr_delay)) %>%
  arrange(origin, desc(dest)) -> flights2a
flights2a

## data.table way
flights1[carrier == "AmerAir", .(meanad = mean(arr_delay)),
        by = .(origin, dest)][order(origin, -dest)]

# Joining

# We'll use the following data.tables to introduce joining.


xdf <- data.table(mykey = c("1", "2", "3"),
                  x_val = c("x1", "x2", "x3"))
xdf

ydf <- data.table(mykey = c("1", "2", "4"),
                  y_val = c("y1", "y2", "y3"))
ydf


# Use the merge() function for all joining in data.table.

# Inner Join:

# data.table way
merge(xdf, ydf, by = "mykey")

# equivalent tidyverse way
inner_join(xdf, ydf, by = "mykey")

# Outer Joins (Left, Right, Full)

# Left Join
# data.table way
merge(xdf, ydf, by = "mykey", all.x = TRUE)

# equivalent tidyverse way
left_join(xdf, ydf, by = "mykey")

# Right Join

# data.table way
merge(xdf, ydf, by = "mykey", all.y = TRUE)

# equivalent tidyverse way
right_join(xdf, ydf, by = "mykey")


# Full Join

# data.table way
merge(xdf, ydf, by = "mykey", all.x = TRUE, all.y = TRUE)

# equivalent tidyverse way
full_join(xdf, ydf, by = "mykey")


# Binding Rows:
  
# data.table way
